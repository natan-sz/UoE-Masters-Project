    "This week was spend planning the term and the focus of the project. Main thing that was discussed was the use of the ISCA Supercomputer or any other research environment we can use for the project. We discussed this with Prof. Russo and he said he would gain us access. After trails of setting up a proper environment last year and knowing how long it will take to gain access, I suggested setting up a virtual machine on my computer that I can make accessible via SSH. I would transfer all the relevant software onto this machine along with the output data from last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledged it would take all of us to catch up with the work done last year. As a reminder of the progress we did last year I suggested others to read through my notes. We also agreed that we would read the SIMPLE-NN and aenet paper again to get a refresher of what we did. \n",
    "\n",
    "The others had some concerns about how they don't feel comfortable with the project as much and would require more guidance on this. They also asked whether they could go back to the labs to carry on with the previous project from before COVID-19 however due to lab closure this was impossible. Nevertheless, they decided to pursue this project splitting the tasks up into manageable tasks. The research was broken into\n",

    "\n",
    "Another thing that was discussed was finding out more about the type of structure we should be studying. I suggested emailing Dr Steve Hepplestone to get more insight. I believe this should be postponed until we have some more solid work to show and go off of as otherwise it would be unfruitful.\n",

    "\n",
    "This week I gathered possible solutions for the hardware I should use for this project. I considered building a home server with a lot of cores and spare parts I have however this came out rather pricey. After a lot of research for the best solution for the project I came to the conclusion that I should host a virtual machine on my computer, open up the port for SSH connections and connect remotely. This would allow for the use of my main computers resources remotely and collaboratively.\n",

    "This is a much bigger improvement from last year's setup as everything is localised in once place. LAMMPS \\& SIMPLE-NN being the main important ones. I also back up this system to a harddrive mostly every week to prevent data loss as thats just scary.\n",

    "Eventually, our supervisor suggested the idea of analysing data collected by others in the lab. He suggested using data from Raman spectroscopy experiments from Phd students. One of the first things that was discussed was calculating the relative thickness of flakes of HfO2. This could be done by sampling one of the flakes and comparing the value to another flake. The more quantitative way of doing this would be to sum over all of the values, take an average (together with an uncertainty) and compare these values to the others. \n",

    "    \n",
    "As I had not much else to do after a milestone, I decided to learn more about Classical Potentials and how they can be used for analysis. In particular I looked at the Tersoff Potential.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Tersoff Potential is a type of a Empirical bond order interatomic potential. The advantage of this type of empirical potential that sets it apart from standard classical empirical potentials such as Lennard Jones is that it can model different bonding states of an atom.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is dervied from the relation of bond strength and the bonding environment parameters. These include bond lengths, angles and the number of bonds.\n",

    "This potential consists of the repulsive two body repulsive term $f_R(r_{ij})$ and an attractive three-body term $f_A(r_{ij})$. All of this is enclosed by a cut off function $f_C(r_{ij})$ that sets the potential for each atom pair at $r>R+D$ where R+D is the cutoff distance. This is chosen to only include the first-neighbor shell.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The $f_A(r_{ij})$ three body term is multiplied by $b_{ij}$ is the bond order which depends on the environment of three particles. More on this later.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Another important aspect of this potential is the angle of the bond (coordination of the system). The $\\zeta_{ij}$ term includes a function $g(\\theta_{ijk})$ where $\\theta_{ijk}$ is the angle between the atoms $i,j$ and $k$.\n",

    "Here clearly lays a glaring issue. There are only two carbon atoms in the simulation. This is not much use as we are trying to study the behaviour of a system of around 72 atoms just like the one from the previous example. Technically I can still use this data as it does contain the behaviour of the correct environment and I have around 30 runs of sp2 structure minimisation. However, I will enquire to Joe to try run a simulation of an sp2 system for heating it up instead.\n",
    "    \n",
    "I emailed Joe Pitfield and he said that the runs are minimisation of the unit cell of the structure which is exactly what I thought. This is clearly not very useful if we are trying to train a neural network based on the number of atom positions. We talked about simulating an sp2 structure of tens of carbon atoms I can use to simulate a larger piece of graphene."

    "In part a) we see how firstly the cartesian coordinates are passed on to the symmetry functions to be used by the neural network. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The main part of this entire method is making sure we get the correct symmetry functions to describe the system. In the iteration of the Behler-Parinello method I am using there are 3 symmetry functions (One radial(2 body), 2 Angular (3 body)) that are fitted to describe the environment around each atom in the simulation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OZN6ZcN.png\" style=\"width:30%:height:auto;\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Similarily to the Tersoff Potential, these are fitted with parameters to describe the system. This could be done manually however it would be counterintuitive to do it this way and it is simple enough to have code to do it for us. Fortunately SIMPLE-NN has a symmetry function fitting feature. The number of parameters to be optimised per symmetry function go like this radial G2(2 parameters) | angular G4(4 parameters) | G5(5 parameters) $\\nu$ and $R_s$ are used for G2. The anuglar functions take in the previous two together with $\\nu$, $\\zeta$ and $\\lambda$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once optimised, each type of symmetry function is saved as a vertex $G_i({R_i})$ in a python pickle file. Then the values are normalised between -1 and 1 and fed into the neural network. This gives the neural network the description of the local environment for each atom. (The symmetry functions are optimised using DFT data). There is a solution for fixing the sampling bias which is called GDF optimisation This prevents imperfections in the material in DFT calculations to transfer to the NN potential simulations. \n",
    " \n",
    "These normalised symmetry functions are then passed onto Tensorflow here test-train data is split and the neural network is trained using the Adam optimiser. There are other optimisers available however from what I have seen Adam is the standard as it is so ahead of the competition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The simple-nn paper also mentiones that to speed up the computing time we can alter the loss function to only include the RMSE in Energy (exclude Force RMSE) however this apparently leads to bias with smaller datasets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "After the training is complete, the final form of the neural network is saved as \"potential_saved_iteration\" This contains the symmetry functions on top and the final state of the neural network in the end. This is then passed to LAMMPS in form of the custom \"pair_style\" command which is a template that takes in parameters (just as Tersoff just this time parameters are symmetry functions parameters and network weights).\n",
    "    \n",
    "This pair_style is a 900 line code of C++ code with little to no documentation so it is really a quest to find what works but from dissecting the code, I see that the code creates symmetry functions for each one of the particles at the time, inputs them into the neural network and obtains a Potential Energy Surface which is then used by LAMMPS to iterate a new step. The literature on this is quite limited and everything i have go off of is from the code so it may not be right. \n",

This is essentially just a C++ script which intakes the parameters needed for three particles and outputs.\n",
