    "This week was spend planning the term and the focus of the project. Main thing that was discussed was the use of the ISCA Supercomputer or any other research environment we can use for the project. We discussed this with Prof. Russo and he said he would gain us access. After trails of setting up a proper environment last year and knowing how long it will take to gain access, I suggested setting up a virtual machine on my computer that I can make accessible via SSH. I would transfer all the relevant software onto this machine along with the output data from last year.\n",

    "We acknowledged it would take all of us to catch up with the work done last year. As a reminder of the progress we did last year I suggested others to read through my notes. We also agreed that we would read the SIMPLE-NN and aenet paper again to get a refresher of what we did. \n",

    "The others had some concerns about how they don't feel comfortable with the project as much and would require more guidance on this. They also asked whether they could go back to the labs to carry on with the previous project from before COVID-19 however due to lab closure this was impossible. Nevertheless, they decided to pursue this project splitting the tasks up into manageable tasks. The research was broken into\n",

I believe this should be postponed until we have some more solid work to show and go off of as otherwise it would be unfruitful.\n",

I considered building a home server with a lot of cores and spare parts I have however this came out rather pricey. After a lot of research for the best solution for the project I came to the conclusion that I should host a virtual machine on my computer, open up the port for SSH connections and connect remotely.

One of the first things that was discussed was calculating the relative thickness of flakes of HfO2. This could be done by sampling one of the flakes and comparing the value to another flake. The more quantitative way of doing this would be to sum over all of the values, take an average (together with an uncertainty) and compare these values to the others. \n",
